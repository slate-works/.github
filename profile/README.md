## 🧭 Philosophy

> In an era of data extraction and surveillance capitalism, we believe software should serve users — not harvest them.

Every Slate Works project is built around a small set of non-negotiable principles:

- 🔐 **Privacy by Design** — Your data stays on your machine. No forced accounts. No silent uploads.  
- 🔎 **Open Source** — Transparent, auditable code. Trust earned through visibility.  
- 🚫 **No Telemetry** — We do not track you. Ever.  
- 🛠️ **Built to Last** — Reliable foundations, clear documentation, long-term maintenance.
