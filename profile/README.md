# Slate Works

**Privacy-first open-source tools. Your data, your machine, your control.**

We build software with old-world craft and modern precision—tools that respect your privacy, run on your infrastructure, and serve your interests above all else.

## Philosophy

In an era of data extraction and surveillance capitalism, we believe software should serve users, not harvest them. Every tool we build follows these principles:

- **Privacy by Design** - Your data stays on your machine
- **Open Source** - Transparent, auditable, trustworthy
- **No Telemetry** - We don't track you, ever
- **Built to Last** - Reliable, well-documented, maintained
